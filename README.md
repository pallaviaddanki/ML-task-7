# SVM Classification - Breast Cancer Dataset

## Objective:
Binary classification using Support Vector Machines with both linear and RBF kernels. Visualized decision boundaries using PCA.

## Tools:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- PCA for visualization

## Steps:
1. Loaded and preprocessed the breast cancer dataset.
2. Trained SVM with linear and RBF kernel.
3. Visualized decision boundary using 2D PCA.
4. Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
5. Evaluated using classification report and cross-validation.

## Results:
- Achieved accuracy ~97% with RBF kernel.
- Visualized decision boundary in 2D.
